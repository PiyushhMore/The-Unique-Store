				<h4><b>Q.Where are your manufacturing facilities located?</b></h4>
										<p>ATLA does not own any company owned production unit. We source and get the products manufactured from the local artisans. Getting products manufactured locally, helps the small scale local artisans sustain the authenticity of their craft.</p>
										
				<h4><b>Q.What if an item is out of stock?</b></h4>
										<p>We try and maintain to keep all the products in stock. However, there may be times when the product can be out of stock due to some unavoidable circumstances. If you wish to still buy the specific out of stock product, you can provide your email to us, so that we are able to notify you when the product is back in stock.</p>
										
				<h4><b>Q.How long will it take to receive my order?</b></h4>
										<p>We make every effort to process your order ASAP! As all the products are made to order, we require 15 working days to manufacture and dispatch order. In case of customized order or order of more than 5 pieces per product or even bulk orders, it may take longer to process, but we will surely keep you updated through email.</p>
										
				<h4><b>Q.What about breakage?</b></h4>
										<p>If you receive a damaged product, let us know within 48 hrs of receiving the product and we’ll get it replaced as soon as possible.</p>
										
				<h4><b>Q.Do you gift wrap these?</b></h4>
										<p>Yes, we love when someone asks us to gift wrap! Just tick on the box for gift wrapping and be ready to put a smile on your loved ones.</p>
